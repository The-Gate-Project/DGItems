CUSTOMIZED ITEMS COLLECTION MOD FOR BALDUR’S GATE 2 THRONE OF BHAAL, BALDUR'S GATE TRILOGY, BALDUR'S GATE II ENHANCED EDITION AND ENHANCED EDITION TRILOGY -
 BY DANIEL GOODRICH - ADAPTED BY PROF ERRATA

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a mod which will give you in exchange for some pennies items, ammunition, weapons and armors in your BG2ToB and BG2EE games, including a very effective armor set and a powerful scimitar very useful for fighters.


Installation:
- BG2ToB or BGT, with the last Bioware official patch 26498, or the GOG version which integrates them already.
- BG2EE or EET

Compatibility:
This mod should be compatible with most of the existing WeiDU mods.

The Mod:
It has been a long time I always installed in my BG2ToB games the old mod SPItems - available in the Sorcerer's Place website - which is the reunification under WeiDU format of 4 old mods, of which 2 about items and 2 about spells. Discarding the mods providing the new spells (rather useless in my opinion), and what is more the Creslyn Item Pack having been already translated in French in the SPStuff mod (available on the Gibberlings 3 website), I've undertaken to translate in French the other items mod designed a long time ago (2002) by Daniel Goodrich. My work has not been limited to a simple translation in due form but too some overhauls here and there, and I hope that the final result (which has brought me to withdraw the Russian version) will please you accordingly; among the items, for example, you may require an amazing pair of boots which will save the day more than once…

FAQ:
Where can we get these items?
 On the Waukeen Promenade, in the Adventurers' Mart, at Deidre's (AR0702).
